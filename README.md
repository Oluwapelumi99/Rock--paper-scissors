# ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS, LIZARD, SPORK.

In this project, I have created a rock,paper scissors Lizard spork
Rock paper scissors Lizard spork is a game of chance, it is an expansion of the classic rock, paper,scissors, this xpansion was created in movie The Big Bang Theory. In this version, 2 additional choices are added, "Lizard" and "Spock" which helps to reduce the likely hood of ties and provide more strategic options.
Each player picks a variable between ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS, LIZARD, SPOCK and reveals it at the same time. The winner is the one who defeats the other. In a tie, the process is repeated until a winnner is found.

## The rules of the game are:
 ### Scissors cuts paper.
 ### Paper covers Rock.
 ### Rock crushes Lizard
 ### Lizard poisons spock
 ### Spock smashes Scissors
 ### Scissors decapitates Lizard 
 ### Lizard eats paper
 ### Paper disproves spock
 ### Spock vaporizes Rock
 ### Rock crushes scissors.
